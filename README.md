# Real time face mask recognition :
  In this project, I will be using deep learning methods (CNN) and opencv to create a model that predict if someone is putting a mask or not in real time. 
  I create 3 models : 
    * VGG architecture
    * ResNet architecture
    * MobileNet architecture
  You can use any model you want.
